# Stellar Engines
The universe is constantly expanding and your star is dying. The only way to survive is to create a stellar engine and set out on an epic quest to the centre of the universe!

# Overview
You are a solar system which has been isolated
due to the expanse of the universe. Your civilisation
will die if you do not construct and use a stellar
engine to traverse the stars and harvest energy
from neighbouring galaxies.

Your goal is to get to the centre of the universe 
and use the energy from the super massive black
hole at the centre to power your civilisation forever.

# Gameplay
You control the power of the engine to traverse space
using a throttle. Gravity is very much a thing so orbits 
are calculated and ajusted depending upon proximity 
to other systems.

Your star reduces in size the more energy you use. To 
increase your stars energy you need to navigate to other
systems and harvest their sun.

This will not be easy, sometimes there are other life forms
and they will defend their systems from outsiders. You
have to build up your own defenses so you can deal with
these situations. To get resources you must min asteroids and planet
and sometimes even canablise your own system. Othertimes systems 
will want to asymalate with you. Other times there are deep 
contagions which you must avoid. You can send out probes to check.

You also have to avoid natural hazards such as asteroid
belts, blackholes and pulsars.

As you get closer to the centre there are other advanced
civilisations which have stellar engines and you must use diplomacy or
force to achieve peace and safety.
